# Assignment of CS7319 SoftwareArchitecture homework1.
# Requirement:
Design and Code (in Java) a pipe and filter application that prints a sorted list of
every unique word in a text file, i.e. each unique word should appear only once on
the output. (4.5 points)
Please submit the following:
1) A diagram depicting the top-level pipe and filter architecture including your
components and connectors. An example of such an architecture diagram is
Figure 4-15 (Lunar Lander in pipe-and-filter style).
2) A UML representation of the classes implementing the top-level architecture in 1).
An example of the UML class diagram is Figure 4-9. Note that you are not
required to use Rational tools to generate the class diagram.
3) A printout of the screenshot showing your successful compilation, the screenshot
of your program output, and your source code of all the .java classes;
4) A mapping between your source code (e.g., .java classes) and the components and
connectors in the architecture depicted in 1) and 2).
Try to name your .java classes consistently with the names of the
components/connectors in your architecture.
The input text file (pftest.txt) is provided for testing and output.
